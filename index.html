        <h2>Playtesting/QA</h2>

        <p>
          I have become well versed in the process of Quality Assurance and able to write up bug reports and test plans. 
          I also go out of my way to do playtesting with companies where possible, both first party developers and third-party researchers.
          It has been great fun to give feedback during these sessions and a wonderful experience being able to see a studio.
          On top of that, I have a large number of Technical, pre-alpha, alphas and betas that I have participated in and left detailed feedback. 
        </p>

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          My greatest accomplishment is my 1st-Class Honours degree in Digital Games Production from the University of Brighton. In the last year, 
          I developed a Machine Learning agent within Unity using an Artificial Neural Network. I also learnt a good number of different subject areas 
          through this course including 3D modelling, animation, vfx audio development, web design and so forth. It was a great course and I thoroughly 
          enjoyed my time and thankful for the skills I learnt to bring forward into ap professional environment!
